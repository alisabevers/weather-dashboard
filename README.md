# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This assignment required me to code a functional weather dashboard, from scratch. I was provided a mock-up for reference and the following requirements:

* Use a server API to allow users to search for a city, and present them with current and future weather conditions for that city
* Once the user searches for the city, that city is added to their search history
* In searching for the city, they are provided with the city name, current date, weather icon, temperature, humidity level, and wind speed
* A 5-day forecast is presented for the appropriate city which displays the same details as above

## Acknowledgments
* Most of the styling was done through Bootstrap. 
* API used for dates: Day.js
* API used for weather details: OpenWeatherMap
